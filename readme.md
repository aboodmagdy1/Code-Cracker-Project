# About Project
     Name : Code Cracker 
     Description : A hacker needs to crack a code (e.g., a 4-digit PIN) by trying combinations. The game uses a search algorithm to explore possible codes

    Search Algorithm: BFS (Hill Climbing: Makes educated guesses based on feedback but may get stuck)
    
    Tools:
    tkinter for a simple GUI.
    Implement BFS with a queue (collections.deque).
    Use sets to track valid combinations
